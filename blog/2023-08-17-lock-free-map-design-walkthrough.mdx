Concurrent data structure design is hard. This blog offers a guided tour on
constructing a special-purpose concurrent map that heavily favors readers. The
article will not just present yet another ready-to-use data structure. Instead,
I will walk you through the design process while solving a real-world problem. I
will even present dead ends that I bumped into along the way. It's a detective
story for programmers interested in concurrent programming. 

By the end of the
article, we will have a concurrent map for storing blobs of data in native
memory. The map is lock-free on a reading path and is also very conservative
with memory allocations. Let's get started!

_This article assumes basics in Java or a Java-like programming language._

## The Problem

I need a concurrent map where keys are strings and values are fixed-size blobs
(public cryptographic keys). This could sound like a
[job for the plain old ConcurentHashMap from JDK](https://twitter.com/PeterVeentjer/status/1685999603684872193),
but there's a twist: the blobs must be available outside of the Java heap.

Why? So that callers can get a pointer to a blob and pass it to Rust code via JNI. The Rust
code then uses the public key to verify digital signatures.

Here's a simplified version of the interface:

```java
interface ConcurrentString2KeyMap {
  void set(String username, long keyPtr);
  long get(String username);
  void remove(String username);
}
```

The `set()` method receives a username and a pointer to a key. The map outlives
the pointers it receives, so it must copy the memory under the received pointers
into its own buffer. In other words: the `get()` method must return a pointer to
this internal buffer, not the original pointer which was used for `set()`.

I can assume the `get()` method will be used frequently and often on the hot
path, while the mutation methods will be invoked rarely and never on the hot
path.

This is roughly how readers are going to use it:

```java
boolean verifySignature(CharSequence username, long challengePtr, int
challengeLen, long signaturePtr, int signatureLen) {
  long keyPtr = map.get(username);
  return AuthCrypto.verifySignature(keyPtr, PUBLIC_KEY_SIZE_BYTES, challengePtr, challengeLen, signaturePtr, signatureLen);
}
```

If there were no mutations, I could have just implemented a pre-populated
immutable lookup directory and called it a day. However, shared mutable state
brings two classes of challenges:

1. Pointer lifecycle management
1. Consistency of map internals

The first issue boils down to ensuring that when a `map.get()` returns a
pointer, the pointer must remain valid and the memory behind it must not change
for _as long as needed_. In our case, it means until the
`AuthCrypto.verifySignature()` returns. 

The second issue is all about concurrent
data-structure design, and we will discuss this in more detail later. Let’s
explore the first issue.

## Pointer lifecycle management

If our map's values were just regular objects managed by the JVM, things could
be simple: `map.get()` would return a reference to an object and then it could
forget this `get()` call ever happened. The `remove()`and `set()` methods would just
remove the map's reference to the value object, and would never change an
already returned object. Easy. But that’s not our case, we are working with
off-heap memory and have to manage it on our own.

Fundamentally, there are two ways to solve it:

1. Change the `get()` contract so it doesn't return a pointer. Instead, it
   receives a pointer from the outside and copies the value there.
1. `get()` still returns a pointer, but the map guarantees the memory behind it
   stays immutable until the caller notifies the map that it’s done and that it won’t
   use the pointer anymore.

### Option 1: Callers own the destination memory

The first option looks interesting. The new contract could look like this:

```java
interface ConcurrentString2KeyMap {
  void set(String username, long srcKeyPtr);
  void get(String username, long dstKeyPtr);
  void remove(String username);
}
```

The caller would own the `dstKeyPtr` pointer and the map would copy the key from
its internals to this pointer and forget this `get()` call ever happened.

This sounds quite nice at first, until we realize it just kicks the can down the
road: it forces every calling thread to maintain its own buffer to pass to
`get()`. If callers are all single-threaded, it’s still easy: each calling
object owns a buffer to pass to `get()` . 

But if calling functions are
themselves concurrent, it becomes more complicated. We have to make sure each calling
thread uses a different buffer. 

Ideally, the buffer would be allocated on stack,
but this is Java so that’s not possible. We certainly do not want to
allocate/deallocate a new buffer in the process heap for every invocation.

So what’s left? Pooling? That’s messy. 

ThreadLocal? Even more messy and harder to
put a cap on the number of buffers. 

Maybe option 1 is not interesting as it seemed
at first.

### Option 2: Lifecycle notifications

Let’s explore the 2nd option. The contract remains the same as outlined in the
original proposal: `long get(String username)`. We have to make sure the memory
behind the pointer remains unchanged until we are done. 

The absolute simplest thing would be to use a read-write lock. 

Each map would have a read-write lock associated, and then readers acquire a read lock before calling `get()` and release it only after returning from `AuthCrypto.verifySignature()`:

```java
boolean verifySignature(CharSequence username, long challengePtr, int
challengeLen, long signaturePtr, int signatureLen) {
  map.acquireReadLock();
  try {
    long keyPtr = map.get(username);
    return AuthCrypto.verifySignature(keyPtr, PUBLIC_KEY_SIZE_BYTES, challengePtr, challengeLen, signaturePtr, signatureLen);
  } finally {
    map.releaseReadLock();
  }
}
```

Mutators would only have to acquire a write lock before calling `set()` or
`remove()`. Not only is this design simple to reason about, it is also simple to
implement. 

Assuming that only `set()` and `remove()` change the internal state,
we can just take a single-threaded map implementation and it will do it. But
there's a catch... It violates our original requirements! 

Readers are often on the
hot-path and we want them to remain lock-free. The proposed design blocks
readers when the map is being updated, so this is a no-go. 

What can we do? We could change the
locking schema to be more fine-grained - instead of locking the whole map we
could lock particular entries. While this would improve practical behaviour, it
would also complicate the map design and the readers could still be blocked when
the same key is being updated. 

What else? We could use an optimistic locking schema, but
this brings its own intricacies.

It’s becoming clear that pointer lifecycle management will have to work in
concert with the internal map implementation. So was this exercise completely
fruitless? Not completely.

There is still one design idea we could reuse: Map users must
explicitly notify that they are no longer using the pointer. 

Let’s explore how to
design map internals!

## Designing a map for Lock-Free readers

I consider myself an experienced generalist. I know bits and bobs about
concurrent programming, distributed systems and all kinds of other areas, but
I’m not really narrowly specialized in any particular topic. 

_A jack of all
trades and master of none?_ Probably. So when I was thinking about a suitable
data structure, I did what every generalist would do in 2023: asked ChatGPT!

<Screenshot
  alt="The author asking ChatGPT about concurrent data-structures. GPT recommends looking at RCU as used in Linux kernel."
  src="/img/blog/2023-08-17/gpt.png"
  title="The actual screenshot of me hunting for a data-structure"
/>

I was amazed GPT realized that I meant to write “single writer” and not “single
reader”, which I took as proof that GPT knows what is it talking about! 🙂 So I
read further: I might have heard about RCU before, but I have never used it
myself. I found the description a bit too vague to be used as an
implementation guide, and it was a lunch time anyway.

### Copy-On-Write intermezzo

While walking to a lunch place, I was thinking about it more and got an idea. Why not 
use the [Copy-On-Write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) technique
to implement a
[persistent map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure)? 

That way, I
could take a regular single-threaded map, and mutators would clone the current map,
do their thing, and then atomically set this newly created map as the map for
readers. Readers would then use whatever map was published as the latest. Published
maps are immutable, thus always safe for concurrent readers, even from multiple
threads,
[lock-free](http://concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.com/2013/05/lock-free-and-wait-free-definition-and.html).
In fact, even wait-free. Yay! 

Additionally, we would have to introduce a
mechanism for safe deallocation of map internal buffers when a stale (=no
longer the latest published map) map has no readers. Otherwise, we would be
leaking memory. That’s a complication, but it feels like something easily
fixable with enough dedication and atomic reference counters.

So this all sounds good, but as have come to expect... there is still a catch. We need to allocate a block
of memory for the map contents on every single mutation. We said that mutations
are rare, so perhaps that’s not a big deal? Maybe it’s not, but one of the
QuestDB design principles is to be conservative with memory allocations as they
cost CPU cycles, memory bandwidth, cause CPU cache thrashing, and in general
tend to introduce unpredictable behaviour.

### Back to the drawing board: Map recycling

So I couldn’t implement a straightforward Copy-On-Write map, but I felt I was on
the right path towards the goal: lock-Free readers. At some point I realized
that, instead of allocating a new map whenever there is a change, I could keep
reusing only 2 maps: one would be available for readers and the other for
writers. 

Once a map is published for readers, it’s guaranteed to be immutable as
long as there is at least one reader still accessing it.

It would look similar to this:

```java
class ConcurrentMap {
  private InternalMap readerMap = new ...
  private InternalMap writerMap = new ...

  void set(String username, long keyPtr) {
    getMapForWriters().set(username, keyPtr);
    swapMaps();
  }

  long get(String username) {
    return getMapForReaders().get(username);
  }

  void remove(String username) {
    getMapForWriters().remove(username);
    swapMaps();
  }
}
```

The idea looks neat, but it’s clear the code as outlined above has a number of
issues and open questions:

1. The code always mutates just a single map, but we clearly need to keep both
   maps in sync. We cannot lose updates.
1. Multiple mutating threads could step on each others toes.
1. If `swapMap()` unconditionally swaps reader and writer maps, the mutating
   thread performing two consecutive mutations could write into a map which
   still has some readers. This violates our invariant: we must not have readers
   and writers concurrently accessing the same internal map.
1. How to implement `getMapForWriters()` and `getMapForReaders()`? 🙂

### Single-writer FTW!

Let’s start with problem #2 - multiple mutating threads. 

We said that
mutations are rare and never on the hot path. Hence, we can afford to be brutal
and use a simple mutex - to make sure there is always at most a single mutator.
The single-writer principle is known to simplify design of concurrent algorithms
anyway. 

Thus the map now looks like this:

```java
class ConcurrentMap {
  private InternalMap readerMap = new ...
  private InternalMap writerMap = new ...
  private final Object writeMutex = new Object();

  void set(String username, long keyPtr) {
    synchronized(writeMutex) {
      getMapForWriters().set(username, keyPtr);
      swapMaps();
    }
  }

  long get(String username) {
    return getMapForReaders().get(username);
  }

  void remove(String username) {
    synchronized(writeMutex) {
      getMapForWriters().remove(username);
      swapMaps();
    }
  }
}
```

That was easy. Maybe violent, but easy.

### Racing threads

Let’s explore something more complicated - problem #3 - multiple consecutive
write operations. What do I mean by this? 

Consider this scenario:

1. We have 2 instances of `InternalMap`, let’s call them `m0` and `m1`.
1. The field `readerMap` references the map `m0` and `writerMap` references
   `m1`.
1. Reader thread calls `map.get()`. Thus `getMapForReaders()` returns `m0`. At
   this point the reader thread is paused by the OS.
1. Writer thread calls `map.set()`. Thus `getMapForWriters()` returns `m1`.
1. Writer modifies `m1` and **swaps the maps**.
1. The field `readerMap` now references the map `m1` and `writerMap` references
   `m0`.
1. Another writer calls `map.set()`. Thus `getMapForWriters()` returns `m0` and
   the writer starts mutating it. The write operation takes a while.
1. The OS resumes the reader thread from #3, and it starts reading `m0` (because
   that’s the map the reader got before its thread was paused!)
1. At this point we have a reader thread concurrently accessing the same
   internal map instance as a writer thread -> **Boom 💥💥💥!**

-->

If the scenario looks too long and boring and you skipped it, here is a short
summary: a reader obtains `mapForReaders` and in the next moment this map
becomes `writerMap`. So what was once a `readerMap` is now a `writerMap` and thus
the next write operation can mutate it at will. Except the stale reader still
thinks the same map is safe for reading. **That’s a bad concurrency bug!**

How can we prevent the racy scenario outlined above? We already use a mutex on
the write path, that’s almost as nasty as it gets. Almost?! Can we be even
nastier? Sure we can! 

Each internal map could have a reader counter and
`getMapForWriters()` won’t return until the reader counter on the current
`mapForWriters` reaches 0. In other words: the writer won’t mutate `writerMap` until
all readers indicate they are no longer using this map. 

How about newly arriving
readers? New readers don’t touch `writerMap` at all, they always load the
current `readerMap` so that’s not a problem. 

Enough talking! Let’s see some
code:

```java
class ConcurrentMap {
  private InternalMap readerMap = new InternalMap();
  private InternalMap writerMap = new InternalMap();
  private final Object writeMutex = new Object();

  void set(String username, long keyPtr) {
    synchronized(writeMutex) {
      getMapForWriters().set(username, keyPtr);
      swapMaps();
    }
  }

  Reader concurrentReader() {
    InternalMap map;
    for (;;) {
      map = readerMap;
      map.readerArrived();
      if (map == readerMap) {
        return map;
      }
      map.readerGone();
    }
  }

  private InternalMap getMapForWriters() {
    InternalMap map = writerMap;
    while(map.hasReaders()) {
      backoff();
    }
    return map;
  }

  void remove(String username) {
    synchronized(writeMutex) {
      getMapForWriters().remove(username);
      swapMaps();
    }
  }

  interface Reader {
    long get(String username);
    void readerGone();
  }

  static class InternalMap implement Reader {
    private final AtomicInteger readerCounter;

    public void readerGone() {
      readerCounter.decrement();
    }

    public void readerArrived() {
      readerCounter.increment();
    }

    public boolean hasReaders() {
      return readerCounter.get() > 0;
    }

    // the rest of a single threaded map impl

  }
}
```

The code above looks way more complex than the previous buggy version. 

Let’s go
briefly through the changes:

1. The most visible change: **the `get()` method is gone!** Instead, there is a
   new method `concurrentReader()` which returns an interface `Reader` with two
   methods: `get()` and `readerGone()`
1. There is a skeleton of `InternalMap`. It does not show any map-related logic,
   because it could be any single-threaded implementation of a map-like
   structure. It only demonstrates that each internal map has its own reader
   counter.
1. For the first time we see an implementation `getMapForWriters()`. It’s
   really not doing anything else except waiting for all the stale readers from the
   `writerMap` to disappear. The `backoff()` method may have various
   implementations and use primitives such as `Thread#yield()` or
   `LockSupport#parkNanos()`.

### Counting readers

Let’s have a closer look at each change. 

Why did we introduce the `Reader`
interface? Isn’t it just an unnecessary complication, and an example of the over-engineering so
prevalent in Java culture? 

Well, maybe, but it simplifies the mechanism for readers to
notify the map that they won’t access the returned pointer anymore. 

How? Each
internal map has its own reader counter. When a reader no longer needs a
pointer returned by a prior `get()`, it must invoke `readerGone()` on the
correct internal map. 

The `Reader` interface does exactly that - it knows which
instance of `InternalMap` is in use. When a thread calls `reader.readerGone()`,
it decrements the reader counter on that map. 

For example:

```java
boolean verifySignature(CharSequence username, long challengePtr, int
challengeLen, long signaturePtr, int signatureLen) {
  ConcurrentMap.Reader reader = map.concurrentReader();
  try {
    long keyPtr = map.get(username);
    return AuthCrypto.verifySignature(keyPtr, [...]);
  } finally {
    reader.readerGone();
  }
}
```

This hopefully made it clearer why we need the `Reader` interface. 

A
little aside: Do you still remember the design idea with a read-write-lock? I
decided not to use it, because it could block readers. But the lock usage
pattern was an inspiration for this notification mechanism.

### Avoiding check-then-act bugs

Let’s focus on the implementation of `concurrentReader()` method. 

It looks like
this:

```java
Reader concurrentReader() {
  InternalMap map;
  for (;;) {
    map = readerMap;
    map.readerArrived();
    if (map == readerMap) {
      return map;
    }
    map.readerGone();
  }
}
```

It loads the current `readerMap`, increments its reader counter, and returns it
to the caller if - and only if - the `readerMap` field still points to the same
`InternalMap` instance. Otherwise, it decrements the reader counter to undo the
increment, and retries everything from start. 

Why this complexity? Why do we
need the retry mechanism at all? It’s to protect us against a similar problem
with stale readers that we already discussed.

Consider this simpler implementation of `concurrentReader()`:

```java
Reader concurrentReader() { // buggy!
  InternalMap map = readerMap;
  map.readerArrived(); // increment the reader counter
  return map;
}

// getMapForWriters() shown for reference only
private InternalMap getMapForWriters() {
  InternalMap map = writerMap;
  while (map.hasReaders()) {
    backoff();
  }
  return map;
}
```

Broken down, we see that:

1. There is a writer thread calling `map.set()` and a reader thread calling
   `map.concurrentReader()`.
1. The reader thread loads the current `readerMap`, but the OS pauses it before
   it increments the reader counter.
1. The writer thread loads the current `writerMap`, does a mutation, and swaps
   the maps. This means the old `readerMap` is now the new `writerMap`.
1. At this point the reader has an instance of `InternalMap` which is also set
   in the `writerMap` field.
1. There is another writer operation. `getMapForWriters()` returns current
   `writerMap` immediately, because the reader counter is still zero. The writer
   thread starts mutating the map.
1. The OS resumes the reader thread. The thread has a reference to the same
   internal map which is currently being mutated by the thread from the previous
   point.
1. The reader thread increments the internal map reader counter, but that’s
   fruitless as the writer thread is already mutating the map.
1. The reader thread `concurrentReader()` returns a map which is being
   concurrently mutated by a writer thread -> **Boom 💥💥💥!**

The extra check in `concurrentReader()` is meant to prevent the above scenario. It guarantees it incremented the reader counter on the map
which is still the current `readerMap`:

```java
Reader concurrentReader() {
  InternalMap map;
  for (;;) {
    map = readerMap;
    map.readerArrived(); // increment the reader counter
    if (map == readerMap) {
      return map;
    }
    map.readerGone();
  }
}
```

It is still possible that a reader thread increments the reader counter, returns
the `Reader` to the caller, and in the next microsecond a writer thread swaps
the maps so the map instance returned to the caller is now set as the
`writerMap`. This is entirely possible, but it won’t do any harm. The
writer won’t get access to the `writerMap` before its reader counter has reached
zero.

### What is left?

At this point we solved the hardest part of the concurrent algorithm, but there
are still some unresolved issues:

1. The map is still losing updates! We have 2 internal maps, but each update
   mutates just a single map.
2. Some smaller bits:
   1. There is no
      [happens-before relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happened-before)
      between writers swapping maps and readers loading them.
   1. The `close()` method is not implemented so the map might leak native
      memory, etc.

### Dealing with lost updates

We can fix the first problem. After swapping the maps, we could wait until the
current `writerMap` has no readers and then update it. 

So mutation operations
would look like this:

```java
void set(String username, long keyPtr) {
  synchronized(writeMutex) {
    getMapForWriters().set(username, keyPtr);
    swapMaps();
    getMapForWriters().set(username, keyPtr);
  }
}
```

This is a safe implementation as the `getMapForWriters()` guarantees that the
returned map has no readers and no new reader will arrive until the next swap.
On the other hand, it's inefficient: when we switch maps after writing, the new
`writerMap` may have stale readers, causing delays until they're cleared.

Is there a better option? It turns out that there is! 

We could change the first
map, swap them and remember the operation including all parameters. During the
next mutation we would replay the operation on the `mapForWriters` and, if
mutations are sufficiently rare, by the time we are replaying the operation the
`writerMap` has no longer any readers. 

Let’s see the code:

```java
void set(String username, long keyPtr) {
  synchronized(writeMutex) {
    InternalMap map = getMapForWriters();
    replayLastOperationOn(map);
    map.set(username, keyPtr);
    swapMaps();
    rememberSetOperation(username, keyPtr);
  }
}
```

The `map.remove()` looks like this:

```java
void remove(String username) {
  synchronized(writeMutex) {
    InternalMap map = getMapForWriters();
    replayLastOperationOn(map);
    map.remove(username);
    swapMaps();
    rememberRemoveOperation(username);
  }
}
```

`rememberSetOperation()` must copy the memory under the pointer to its own
buffer, but we only have to remember a single operation. Given our blobs are
fixed-size, it allows us to keep reusing the same replay buffer. Zero
allocation.

### Playing by the Java Memory Model rules

Now let’s do the last, important change. 

This is how the `ConcurrentMap` looks
like:

```java
class ConcurrentMap {
  private InternalMap readerMap = new InternalMap();
  private InternalMap writerMap = new InternalMap();
  private final Object writeMutex = new Object();
  private final WriterOperation lastWriterOperation;
  [...]
}
```

The whole mutable state is encapsulated in these 4 objects. The fields
`writerMap` and `lastWriterOperations` are only accessed by a writer thread
while holding a mutex. But the `readerMap` field is set by a writer thread and
then loaded by readers. 

Readers are lock-free, they do not acquire any mutex
before accessing the reader map. That is a
[data race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Data_race) and it could
cause visibility issues. 

The fix is easy, just mark the `readerMap` as
`volatile`:

```java
class ConcurrentMap {
  private volatile InternalMap readerMap = new InternalMap();
  private InternalMap writerMap = new InternalMap();
  private final Object writeMutex = new Object();
  private final WriterOperation lastWriterOperation;
  [...]
```

The writer path now looks like this:

1. Acquire a mutex
1. Load the current `writerMap`
1. Wait until all stale readers are gone
1. Replay the last operation
1. Do a new mutation
1. Swap `readerMap` and `writerMap`
1. Remember the operation so it can be replayed on the untouched map during the
   new mutation

The `readerMap` is now marked as volatile, giving us
[sequential consistency](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/sequential).

Colloquially speaking, the readers will see the most recent map swap done by a
writer thread. The readers are also guaranteed to see all changes which were
performed before the writer thread set the map as `mapForReaders`. And that’s
it!

### Summary

We walked through a process of designing a concurrent data-structure which is
lock-free on the read path. We could generalize some of the design principles we
applied into the following rules:

1. **Single Writer Rule**: Use a mutex for writes, ensuring only one writer at
   any time.
1. **Dual Maps**: Maintain two maps – one for readers and another for the
   writer.
1. **Pointer Swap Mechanism**: When a writer updates, it operates on the
   `mapForWriters` and then switches the roles of the two maps.
1. **Reader Counter**: Each map has an atomic `readerCounter`. As a reader
   begins, the counter increments and decrements upon completion. This ensures
   that no one accesses the `mapForWriters` until all active readers from the
   previous swap have completed their reads.
1. **Change Tracking**: Writers, when updating `mapForWriters`, log their
   modifications. This is crucial since we need to replicate these changes to
   `mapForReaders`, which might still be in use by some readers. Instead of
   waiting for all readers to shift to the new map, we log the change and apply
   it in the subsequent update. Given that we switch maps post-update, by the
   time of the next update, `mapForWriters` is likely free of old readers,
   allowing for immediate change application.

### What’s next?

We have a working implementation of a concurrent map, but it’s not yet ready for
production. There are still some issues to be solved:

1. The `close()` method is not implemented so the map might leak native memory.
   This is trivial to fix and I leave it as an exercise for the reader.
1. There are no tests! There are various ways to test concurrent data
   structures. You could use a stress test, where you spawn a lot of threads and
   let them mutate the map in a random way and then check the consistency of the
   map and some invariants. You could learn
   [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) and write a formal
   model of the map and then verify it.
1. Performance optimizations. The current implementation uses the same write path
   on both internal maps. Chances are that's not the best option. For example
   there is no reason to calculate the hash code twice. There is no reason to
   locate the bucket twice. The first `set()` could remember which bucket was
   used and the second `set()` could reuse it. We could also add batching to the
   writer path: the current implementation swaps the maps after every mutation.
   This is inefficient when writers are mutating the map in a tight loop.

### Acknowledgements

After I finished the implementation, I got really excited and I wanted to share
it with the world. I naively thought that I was the first one to come up with
this idea. I was wrong. 

First, I found the
[Double Instance Locking](http://concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.com/2013/11/double-instance-locking.html)
pattern at the amazing
[Concurrency Freaks](http://concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.com/) blog. This pattern
is very similar to the one I described here. It also uses 2 internals structures
and readers are alternating between them. It uses a read-write lock to protect
the map being mutated. Given there is only a single writer then at any given
time there is at least one internal map which is available for reading. This
gives readers lock freedom. 

It's fair to say that the Double Instance Locking
pattern is simpler to reason about. It decomposes the problem better. But I'd still
argue my contribution is the trick with delayed replay of the last operation -
if writers are sufficiently rare, then writers won't be blocked at all.

The same blog also links to the paper
[Left-Right: A Concurrency Control Technique with Wait-Free Population Oblivious Reads](https://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ccfreaks/papers/LeftRight/leftright-extended.pdf?viasf=1)
which on the surface also looks similar. It claims not only Lock-Freedom, but also
Wait-Freedom. I have yet to deep dive into it.

I would like to thank to reviewers of this article:

encouragement I would not find the courage to publish this article! ❤️ Of
course, all the mistakes still left are solely my responsibility.
