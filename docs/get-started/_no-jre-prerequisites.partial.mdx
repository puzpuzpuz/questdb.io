:::note

This package differs from others by not embedding Java.

You should use it only if there is no package specific to your platform.  
In practice, this often means ARM Linux.

:::

#### Java 11

You need to have Java 11 installed locally. To check your installed version:

```shell
java -version
```

If you do not have Java installed, install one of the following supported
packages for your operating system:

- AdoptOpenJDK
- Amazon Corretto
- OpenJDK
- Oracle Java

Other Java distributions might work but are not tested.

#### `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to point to your Java 11 installation
folder.
